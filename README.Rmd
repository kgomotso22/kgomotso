## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. she's the coolest cat in town

## Assignment 2
```{r quick_look, echo=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim.data.frame(anscombe)
colnames(anscombe)
head(anscombe)
tail(anscombe)
summary(anscombe)
```

## Assignment 3
```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dev='svg', fig.path= './figures/'}
data("anscombe")
with(anscombe, plot(x1, y1))
abline(lm(y1~x1, data = anscombe))
```

## Assignment 4
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("analgesic.csv")
```
```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
dim.data.frame(df)
colnames(df)
head(df)
tail(df)
summary(df)
```
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

altered_df <- df %>%
  # Tidy up df data from wide to long format
  gather(key = Measurements, 
         value = results, 
         Measurement_1:Measurement_3) %>%
  # Set group factor
  group_by(Measurements) %>%
  # Summarise the data by calculating the mean across the measurements on each individual
  summarise (mean = mean(results)) %>%
  # Ungroup
  ungroup()
  #Print out the final data frame
  altered_df

```
## Assignment 5
#chunk 1
```{r Chick weights, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypotheses
# H0: The weights of the chicks is not dependent on the feed

## Alternative hypotheses
#H1: The weights of the chicks depends on the feed

#read data
chicken <- read_csv("chick-weights.csv")

# Tidy data using boxplot
boxplot(weight~feed, data= chicken)

# Statistical tests 
chickstat <-aov(weight~feed, data = chicken)
summary(chickstat)

## Test statistic and underlying assumptions
#compares samples of 3 or more groups

# Degrees of freedom
DF= 5

## P-Value
#P<0.05

## Interpretation of outcome
#Reject null hypotheses therefore the weights of the chicks is dependent on the feed
```
#chunk 2
```{r The Hote Zone, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypotheses
#H0: The contaminated water does not cause gastroenteritis

## Alternative hypotheses
#H1: The contaminated water causes gastroenteritis 

#read data
gastroenteritis <- read_csv("gastroenteritis (1).csv")

# Tidy data using scatterplot
y <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data= gastroenteritis)
y

# plotting the barplot
barplot(y, beside = TRUE, ylab = 'Consumption', xlab = 'Outcome', main = 'gastroenteritis', col= c ('blue', 'purple', 'yellow')) 
legend('top', c('<1 glasses/day', '>4 glasses/day', '1 to 4 glasses/day'), fill = c('blue', 'purple', 'yellow'))


# Statistical tests 
Z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)
Z

## Test statistic and underlying assumptions
#analyses two categorical variables
#determines an association between two variables


# Degrees of freedom
DF= 2

## P-Value
#p<0.05

## Interpretation of outcome
#Reject NULL hypothese therefore the contaminated water causes gastroenteritis
```
#chunk 3 
```{r Nausea, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypotheses
#H0: Receiving a 5HT3-receptor blocker does not reduce nausea

## Alternative hypotheses
#H1: Receiving a 5HT3-receptor blocker does reduce nausea

#read data
nausea <- read_csv("nausea (1).csv")

## Tidy data
#The numeric rating scale is anchored at 0 (no nausea) to 6 (severe nausea) therefore remove row 9 (patient 8)

# Plot line graph

plot(nausea$Nausea_before~nausea$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0,6), xlab = "Patient", ylab = "Nausea numeric rating score", main = "The intensity of nausea before and after receiving a 5ht3-receptor blocker", col= "purple", lwd= 2)
lines(nausea$Nausea_after~nausea$Patient, col= "green", lwd= 2)
legend ("top", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"),fill = c("purple", "green"))

# Statistical test
wilcox.test(nausea$Nausea_before,nausea$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)

## Test statistic and underlying assumptions
#The analyses two variables which are paired and non-parametric within one population group in order to determine the association between them

## p-value
#p<0.05

## Interpretation of outcome
#Reject null hypotheses therefore receiving a 5HT3-receptor blocker reduces nausea
```

## Assignment 6
#chunk 1
```{r Housing Prices, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypotheses
#H0: The Housing Prices does not depend on the interest rates

## Alternative Hypotheses
#H1: The Housing Prices depend on the interest rates

#read data
library(readr)
housing <- read_csv("housing-prices.csv")

# Tidy data 
interest= housing$interest_rate
house_price= housing$median_house_price_USD
head(cbind(interest, house_price))


#plot scatterplot
plot(interest, house_price, xlab = "interest", ylab = "house_price")
abline(lm(housing$median_house_price_USD~housing$interest_rate, data=housing), col= "pink", lwd=2)

## Statistic test
# Linear Regression
housing1 <- lm(housing$median_house_price_USD~housing$interest_rate, data=housing)
summary(housing1)

## Plotting diagnostic plots

# Diagnostic 1: Homoskedasticity
plot(x=housing1$fitted.values, housing1$residuals, main = "Homoskedasticity", col= "orange")
abline(h=0, col= "purple", lwd= 2)

# Diagnostic 2: QQ plot
qqnorm(housing1$residuals)
qqline(housing1$residuals)

# Binary outcome variable
glm(housing$median_house_price_USD~housing$interest_rate, data=housing)


## Test statistic and underlying assumptions
#Scatter plot was done to determine the relationship between the two variables and the outliers 
#Linear regression diagnostics were used to determine whether there was a linear trend. #Additionally, diagnostics were also used to determine whether the residuals were normally distributed and if the residuals have the same variance for all the fitted values of y.


# Degrees of freedom
15

# P-value
 p= 0.02
 p<0.05

# Interpretation of outcome
The null hypotheses is thus rejected therefore the house prices depend on the interest rates.
